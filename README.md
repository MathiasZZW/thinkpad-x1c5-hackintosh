#### READ THE ENTIRE README.MD BEFORE YOU START.

#### I am not responsible for any damages you may cause.

> ## Update


#### Added

- ACPI hotpatches

#### Changed

- Switched to OpenCore to 0.5.8
- Upgraded various kexts.
- remove ApfsDriverLoader.efi as per OC changelog

> ## SUMMARY:

**`In short, x1c5-hackintosh is very stable and is currently my daily driver. I use macOS and Windows on this machine and both provide an enjoyable experience. Overall macOS is a rockslid performer so I can fully recommend this.`**


> ## NEEDED:

A macOS machine would be VERY useful: to create install drives, and for when your ThinkPad cannot boot. Though it is not completely necessary.  
Flash drive, 16GB or more.  
Xcode works fine for editing plist files, but I prefer [PlistEdit Pro](https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/plisteditpro/).  
[MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL), for patching ACPI tables.  
[IOJones](https://github.com/acidanthera/IOJones), for diagnosis.  
[Hackintool](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335018-hackintool-v286/), for diagnosis.

> ## WHERE TO START:

Explore links included this README, especially those in references and other x1c6-hackintosh repos.

Once you are ready, follow the series of README files included `docs/`.  
[**1_README-HARDWAREandBIOS**](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/1_README-HARDWAREandBIOS.md): Requirements before starting.  
[**2_README-installMEDIA**](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/2_README-installMEDIA.md): Creating the macOS install drive.  
[**3_README-POSTinstallation**](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/3_README-POSTinstallation.md): Settings and tweaks post installation.  
[**4_README-ACPIpatching**](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/4_README-ACPIpatching.md): The hardest and most time consuming part, patching the system ACPI table for battery status, brightness, sleep, thunderbolt, thunderbolt hotplugging, etc...  
[**5_README-other.md**](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/5_README-other.md): for other notices

- While you can plug-and-play most of my hotpatches if you have an x1c5, I still suggest that you dump and disassemble your own DSDT. This is imprortant as your DSDT maybe different from mine. And furthermore, you get to learn more about what's actually going on.
